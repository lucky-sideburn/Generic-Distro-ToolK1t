# GDT (Generic Distro Toolkit) - Under Development ðŸš§

What is GDT?
================
The **Generic Distro Toolkit (GDT)** is a cutting-edge project under the **Garanti Del Talento** initiative. It empowers you to craft your own custom GNU/Linux distro from scratch using the power of **Linux From Scratch (LFS)** ([LFS website](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)), **Ansible**, and **Jenkins**.

```
OxHrtz - GNU/Linux Distro
==============================
I am working on a GNU/Linux distro called **OxHrtz**, designed to include powerful integration with **containers** and **Kubernetes (k8s)**. This distribution aims to simplify container management and orchestration, making it ideal for cloud-native and DevOps environments.

How to Use
=============
ðŸ”§ Spin Up Jenkins Jobs with Ansible
------------------------------------
Fire up a Jenkins job with a single command:

    ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts.ini playbooks/start.yml 

Auto-Generate Redmine Issues for Tools
-----------------------------------------
Let the script do the heavy lifting. Generate Redmine issues for every tool in the compilation pipeline:

    cd playbooks/roles/ansible-gdt/vars
    python3 redmine.py

Every LFS step and additional configuration is meticulously defined here:
